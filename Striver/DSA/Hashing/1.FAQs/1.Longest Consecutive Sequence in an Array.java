    APPROACH - BRUTE FORCE
    1. Iterate through the array, treating each element as the start of a sequence.
    2. Use a helper function (linear search) to check for consecutive elements.
    3. Count the length of the sequence and update the longest streak.

    TIME COMPLEXITY
    - O(N^2), due to the nested loop caused by linear search for each element.

    SPACE COMPLEXITY
    - O(1), since no extra space is used.

    APPROACH - SORTING BASED SOLUTION
    1. Sort the array to bring consecutive elements together.

    TIME COMPLEXITY

    - O(1), since sorting is done in-place.

    APPROACH - HASHSET OPTIMIZATION
    1. Store all numbers in a HashSet for O(1) lookups.
