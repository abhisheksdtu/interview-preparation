You are given an array `arr` of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element is considered a leader if it is **greater than or equal to** all elements to its right. The rightmost element is always a leader.

#### Examples

```
Input: arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2] 
Output: [17, 5, 2]
Explanation: There is nothing greater on the right side of `17`, `5`, and `2`.
```
```
Input: arr = [10, 4, 2, 4, 1] 
Output: [10, 4, 4, 1]
Explanation: Both of the `4`s are in the output because to be a leader an equal element is also allowed on the right side.
```
```
Input: arr = [5, 10, 20, 40] 
Output: [40]
Explanation: When an array is sorted in increasing order, only the rightmost element is a leader.
```
```
Input: arr = [30, 10, 10, 5] 
Output: [30, 10, 10, 5]
Explanation: When an array is sorted in non-increasing order, all elements are leaders.
```
#### Constraints

- `1 <= arr.size() <= 10^6`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
